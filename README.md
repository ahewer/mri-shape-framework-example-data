## Example Data for the mri-shape-framework

This repository contains sample MRI data and corresponding configuration files to be used with our [mri-shape-framework](https://github.com/m2ci-msp/mri-shape-framework).

### MRI data

The MRI data was kindly provided by [Adam Baker](http://adambaker.org/qmu.php) and converted by us to the used [scan format] (https://github.com/m2ci-msp/mri-shape-tools/blob/master/dataFormats/scan.md).
Please remember that this data is still the property of Adam Baker.

### Using the sample data

Just download the ZIP file from the releases page and unpack it in the root directory of our framework.
Running the framework will then create a PCA model.
